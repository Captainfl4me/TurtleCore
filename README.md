# Turtle Core 1

This is a homemade 8bits CPU architecture. The goal of this project is to learn how CPU work and have fun. I will base my architecture on the 6502 processor (because I will use 6502 assembly language). This way we can easily compare our results with a real 6502 and see how our perform.

## CPU Architecture

As all CPU Turtle core 1 is motsly build around differente register links with multiple 8bits BUS.
